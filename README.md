# Horiseon code refactor

## Description
This is a submission for the first weekly challenge assignment for the USYD coding Bootcamp. In this assignment, we were asked to refactor the HTML of a sample code in order to meet accessbiility standards.

This challenge required us to:
- Identify elements/tags that required refactoring 
- Use our understanding of HTML to update the tags to their semantic equivalent

The challenge was addressed through the following:
- Changed div elements to their semantic equivalents:
 - Changed div elements used for header, footer and body elements
 - Changed div elements in 'main' to article
 - Changed div containter to aside and refactored elements within to article
- Added alt tags to all images 
- Condensed CSS class/id based selectors that were the same and put them into one css rule. These include:
 - selectors for header and footer
 - article elements in main and article elements in aside
